            <p> "I feel way too tired today and I didn't get enough sleep."
                Tomorrow you won't be any less tired than you are today.
                "I am so busy right now, I don't have time"
                An hour workout is 4% of your day.
                "I will do it tomorrow"
                Yesterday you said tomorrow.
                "Its too hard and takes too much energy"
                The pain you feel today is the strength you will feel tomorrow.
                "Everyone else is pros and I don't even know where to start"
                You don't have to be great to start, but you have to start to be great.

            <h2>The Benefits of Exercise</h2>
            <p> Maintaining good health and fitness is crucial for overall well-being and quality of life. Physical
                activity and a balanced diet help reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease,
                diabetes, and cancer.
                <em>Exercise can also boost mood, reduce stress, and improve mental health.</em>
                It strengthens bones and muscles, improves flexibility, and promotes a healthy weight. Additionally,
                good nutrition provides the body with essential nutrients and energy to function properly. A healthy
                lifestyle can improve longevity, increase energy levels, and enhance cognitive function. By prioritizing
                health and fitness, individuals can enjoy a better quality of life and reduce their risk of preventable
                health problems.
